How to use the WSPBuilder
-------------------------
The WSPbuilder program builds WSP based on a folder structure.
Add your solution files to this folder structure and you do not need to specify any
thing else.

To auto generate the folder structure use the -createfolder argument.
To show the help use the -help argument.
Otherwise the wspbuilder will assume that you will build an manifest.xml and wsp file.

The root folder structure that WSPBuilder depends on looks like following:

12
80
GAC

The 12 folder represents the folders found in
"%Program Files%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12"
The 12 sub folders must have the same folder structure as the SharePoint 12 folder.
E.g:
12\ISAPI
12\Template\Features
12\Template\Layouts\1033
and so on.
Folders that are not used, do not need to be specified.
It is possible to define your own folders and they will be included in the solution.

If you want to build a Solution for a custom feature. Create the following structure.
"12\Template\Features\MyCustomFeature" and add your feature files to the MyCustomFeature
folder.

The 80 folder represents the WebApplication folder and contains following subfolders
80\bin, 80\wpcatalog, 80\resources. The 80\bin contains the dll's. If you have some
webpart definitions (webpart, dwp) files, they goes into the wpcatalog folder.
Any file can be added to the resource folder.

The GAC folder contains all DLL's that goes into the Global Assembly Cache on
installation. It is possible to define satellite assemblies within the same folder.

ClassResource files for a DLL, can be added to the folder in "80\wpresources\[DLL name without the '.dll']"
See the demo project where the path is : 80\wpresources\wspdemo
You are free to add any file and make a folder structure if you like.

You can create the folder structure anywhere you like. But I prefer to add them in
the root of my SharePoint Visual Studio projects.

CustomCAS, this parameter specifies an external file that contains custom CAS to append custom IPermission entries to the manifest.xml file.

Example of Custom CAS file:
<IPermission class="System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" Unrestricted="True" version="1" Read="C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\CONTROLTEMPLATES\QuickMessageControl.ascx" Write="$AppDir$" Append="$AppDir$" PathDiscovery="$AppDir$" />
<IPermission class="AspNetHostingPermission" version="1" Level="Medium" />
<IPermission class="System.Net.Mail.SmtpPermission, System, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" version="1" Access="Connect" />


When you are done adding your files, just call the WSPBuilder application from the
root of the folder structure. The WSPBuilder has been setup with default setting to
automatically build a manifest.xml and WSP file. The manifest.xml file is automatically
included in the WSP file.
After the WSPBuilder application has run, it will create three files:

mysolution.wsp      The file name is default taken from the current folder.
manifest.xml        Contains the solution xml definition.
solutionid.txt      Contains the solution id for reusing on the next build.

The WSPBuilder.exe returns a 0 (int) when success full, otherwise a 1 when an exception has occurred.

If you want use the arguments, you use them as parameters or create a WSPBuilder.exe.config for
the WSPBuilder application.

WSPBuilder.exe.config
--------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <!--
    Optional settings
    You can set the arguments in this file or use them directly in the console.
    All arguments has a defualt value. See wspbuilder -help

 The WSPBuilder.exe.config has to be located in the same folder as the WSPBuilder application.



Arguments --------------------------------- 

-12Path [Path] (Default is the [current directory]/12)
Specifies where the 12 folder is located.

-80Path [Path] (Default is the [current directory]/80)
Specifies where the 80 folder is located.

-BinPath [Path] (Default is the [current directory]\80\bin)

I can really recommend this application for installing SharPoint Solutions (WSP) with. I use it all the
time my self (no more command line STSADM).
